# Country-Finder

This web application offers users an interactive and detailed experience when exploring country information. It has been built with pure JavaScript for the management of the components, HTML and CSS for structue, layout and styling; in addition to the use of Bootstrap 5 for styling most of the elements.

The core of the project is based on integration with the [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/). The application makes requests to this API for up-to-date country data. With this implementation, it was necessary to include management for promises, to ensure the data integrity; and by consequence the use of async/await functions.

The presentation of the information is carried out through interactive tables that allow users to sort the data according to their needs. In addition, the search capability filters the table's countries' information, so it is possible to look for an specific country. Additional country details, such as flag and demographic information, are elegantly presented through interactive modalities.
